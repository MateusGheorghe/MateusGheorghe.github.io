# About me

Hello! My name is Mateus Gheorghe de Castro Ribeiro.  Subsequently, he received his masterâ€™s degree in mechanical engineering focused on applied mechanics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil. In the latter institution, he also held the position of R&D Engineer. His main work was focused on developing signal processing and machine learning techniques in Oil & Gas field applications. Mateus` research situates at the intersection of engineering and artificial intelligence (AI). He has worked on themes that included fuzzy logic systems, ultrasonic waves, signal processing, and Structural Health Monitoring. In 2022, he will be joining the Sustainable Design and Construction Ph.D. program in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. His main area of research will focus on AI applied to monitoring and control of energy systems.
